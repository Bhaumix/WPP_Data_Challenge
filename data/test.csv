Where appropriate, the study breaks down these corporate numbers to identify earnings by brand and, more specifically, the brand's intangible earnings. To create these unique rankings, expert analysts combine this information on financial performance with other publicly available data, including data from Bloomberg, Kantar Worldpanel and Kantar Retail, as well as customer-level research from BrandZ – the world’s largest brand equity database. BrandZ contains data on brands gathered from interviews with over three million consumers in over 50 markets and covering more than 400 different categories. These interviews enable the BrandZ team at Kantar to calculate the exact contribution the brand makes in driving purchase decisions; an approach proven to correlate with sales. The BrandZ rankings provide a detailed and rigorous analysis that combines present and future earnings with real consumer perceptions and behaviour.

Amazon this year surpassed Apple and Google to reach the No.1 rank in the BrandZ™ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands. With a 52 percent year-on-year increase, Amazon achieved a brand value of $315.5 billion. To put that accomplishment in perspective, consider that this triumvirate of disruptive ecosystem brands together total amost $1 trillion in brand value and comprise about 20 percent of the value generated by the BrandZ™ Top 100. With its devotion to removing friction from every part of the customer experience, Amazon has changed what consumers expect from brands. With its pioneering efforts in cloud computing, Amazon has changed what businesses expect from their suppliers and partners. These feats, neither inevitable nor predictable, yield important brand-building lessons. Amazon is a serial disruptor. Most important, Amazon is not alone. In a world with customer expectations shaped by Amazon and other disruptors, many of them from China, having a strong brand becomes even more critical. It is why the 2019 BrandZ™ Global Top 100 increased 7 percent in brand value, a significant rise given the manifold market disruptions. The 7 percent increase was more than twice the growth rate of global GDP. The ranking added $328 billion in value year-over-year. And during the turbulent period since 2006, the BrandZ™ Top 10 Most Powerful Brands Portfolio of stocks grew two-and-a-half times faster than the S&P, proving that investment to create and sustain strong brands delivers superior shareholder returns.

Artificial intelligence advances mean devices and platforms can already maintain conversations, make decisions for us and may one day even replace humans in their last territory of superiority: creativity.

So, ongoing uncertainty is piling pressure on brands that are, quite understandably, becoming reluctant to invest. But that pressure is being intensified by fast-changing consumer habits and evolving expectations of brands. The result is that bold newcomers – often digitally enabled ones – are seizing the opportunity to meet consumers’ heightened demands for convenience, choice, experience and service.

In practice, most CPIs are calculated as weighted averages of the percentage price changes for a speciﬁed set, or ‘‘basket’’, of consumer products, the weights reﬂecting their relative importance in household consumption in some period. CPIs are widely used to index pensions and social security benefits. CPIs are also used to index other payments, such as interest payments or rents, or the prices of bonds. CPIs are also commonly used as a proxy for the general rate of inﬂation, even though they measure only consumer inﬂation. They are used by some governments or central banks to set inﬂation targets for purposes of monetary policy. The price data collected for CPI purposes can also be used to compile other indices, such as the price indices used to deﬂate household consumption expenditures in national accounts, or the purchasing power parities used to compare real levels of consumption in different countries. In an effort to further coordinate and harmonize the collection of CPI data, the international organizations agreed that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) would assume responsibility for the international collection and dissemination of national CPI data. Under this data collection initiative, countries are reporting the aggregate all items index; more detailed indexes and weights for 12 subgroups of consumption expenditure (according to the so-called COICOP-classification), and detailed metadata. These detailed data represent a valuable resource for data users throughout the world and this portal would not be possible without the ongoing cooperation of all reporting countries. In this effort, the OECD collects and validates the data for their member countries, including accession and key partner countries, whereas the IMF takes care of the collection of data for all other countries."" **Cite:** Consumer Price Index, International Monetary Fund The Data is provided to Users “as is” and without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.

CORD-19 is a resource of over 29,000 scholarly articles, including over 13,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up. **Call to Action** We are issuing a call to action to the world's artificial intelligence experts to develop text and data mining tools that can help the medical community develop answers to high priority scientific questions. The CORD-19 dataset represents the most extensive machine-readable coronavirus literature collection available for data mining to date. This allows the worldwide AI research community the opportunity to apply text and data mining approaches to find answers to questions within, and connect insights across, this content in support of the ongoing COVID-19 response efforts worldwide. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid increase in coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical community to keep up. A list of our initial key questions can be found under the **[Tasks](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks)** section of this dataset. These key scientific questions are drawn from the NASEM’s SCIED (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats) [research topics](https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/03-11-2020/standing-committee-on-emerging-infectious-diseases-and-21st-century-health-threats-virtual-meeting-1) and the World Health Organization’s [R&D Blueprint](https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/Global_Research_Forum_FINAL_VERSION_for_web_14_feb_2020.pdf?ua=1) for COVID-19. Many of these questions are suitable for text mining, and we encourage researchers to develop text mining tools to provide insights on these questions. **Accessing the Dataset** We have made this dataset available on Kaggle, and are periodically updating it from its source.

Using data from a sampling of clients, we are tracking year-over-year trends in ecommerce revenue, ad spend, and conversion rate relative to the pre-COVID benchmark period. Visit for daily updates to see how your performance compares to your competitors as the volatility continues. For insight into how to best weather the storm, read our recent whitepaper, ""Digital strategies to get your brand through Coronavirus."" For the most up to date information, please visit https://covid19.within.co/covid-19retailpulse/ and sign up for updates as they are released. **How to Read the Graphs** These graphs illustrate how sectors are performing now versus their pre-COVID benchmark periods. So if the sector was up 10% YoY before COVID-19, and the sector is now down 15% YoY, we would report that as down 25% versus the benchmark period. You can click the graph keys to turn on & off different data points. E.g., if you want to see just revenue and CvR, click the color icons to turn off Facebook and Google spend. @(https://infogram.com/1pe5x1plvvppqmfm9lg7qxkvvlfl9y5zqxm) @(https://infogram.com/1p2jyk9xrnzpl0u091llwlv0wkirwgn7n6y) @(https://infogram.com/1pkr53gezjy1r5u9xn6n1lw5z9s3dneqzw7) @(https://infogram.com/1prlrgj5q9p5rjug2l9ezjkdm5hm262eggd) @(https://infogram.com/1p2nl1ykyywmw0s09q6wl0qzd2urnp0gw1g) **About the Data** This data is based on our [WITHIN] clients' first-party data in US ecommerce. We manage over $500MM in media spend for fast-growing VC-backed startups and Fortune 100 companies. Our partners collectively drive over $5B in ecommerce revenue. We place clients into their respective verticals for these graphs, and some clients appear in more than one vertical. For example, if you are an omnichannel fashion brand you would be grouped into both the omnichannel and fashion sectors. An average-sized client has the following daily metrics: 100k sessions, 1900 transactions, $350k revenue. **Disclaimer:** This dataset is not for commercial use by WPP, it is for informative purposes only.

This procedure follows the OECD Handbook on Constructing Composite Indicators (OECD, 2008), which is a good reference for methodological suggestions. There are a number of examples in the literature of constructing composite indices that compare and rank country performance. These include the IMF Financial Stress Index (Cardarelli, Elekdag, and Lall, 2008; Cardarelli, Elekdag, and Lall, 2009), various financial inclusion indices (Amidžić, Massara, and Mialou, 2014; Camara and Tuesta, 2014), and the United Nations Development Programme well-being indices, such as the Human Development Index, Gender-Inequality Index, Gender Development Index, and Multidimensional Poverty Index (UNDP, 2014). * Sectoral Coverage: A set of key indicators is chosen to capture the different aspects of the financial system characteristics.

wppdatacatalogue,fiscal-monitor-fm,Fiscal Monitor (FM),Indicators of public financial development 1990 - 2021,"--- {""editor"":""simple""} --- **Data Origin:** Open data linked via [@imf](https://data.world/imf) **Who:** Dataset owned and managed by International Monetary Fund **What:** * **Geographic Coverage:** The Fiscal Monitor database covers 115 countries and several regional aggregates (see Economy Groupings for more details). * **Methodology:** Country-specific data and projections for key fiscal variables are based on the World Economic Outlook database, unless indicated otherwise, and compiled by the IMF staff. Historical data and projections are based on the information gathered by IMF country desk officers in the context of their missions and through their ongoing analysis of the evolving situation in each country; they are updated on a continual basis as more information becomes available. Structural breaks in data may be adjusted to produce smooth series through splicing and other techniques. IMF staff estimates serve as proxies when complete information is unavailable. As a result, Fiscal Monitor data can differ from official data in other sources, including the IMF’s International Financial Statistics. The country classification in the Fiscal Monitor divides the world into three major groups: 35 advanced economies, 40 emerging market and middle-income economies, and 40 low-income developing countries. The seven largest advanced economies in terms of GDP (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) constitute the subgroup of major advanced economies, often referred to as the Group of Seven (G7). The members of the euro area are also distinguished as a subgroup. Composite data shown in the tables for the euro area cover the current members for all years, even though the membership has increased over time. Data for most EU member countries have been revised following the adoption of the new European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010). The low-income developing countries are those designated eligible for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) in the 2013 PRGT-eligible review and whose per capita gross national income was less than the PRGT income graduation threshold for “non-small” states—that is, twice the operational threshold of the International Development Association, or $2,390 in 2011, as measured by the World Bank’s Atlas method. Zimbabwe is included in the group. Emerging market and middle-income economies include those not classified as advanced economies or low-income developing countries. See Economy Groupings for more details. All fiscal data refer to the general government, where available, and to calendar years, except for Bangladesh, Egypt, Haiti, Hong Kong SAR, India, Iran, Lao P.D.R., Pakistan, Singapore, and Thailand, for which they refer to the fiscal year. Composite data for country groups are weighted averages of individual-country data, unless otherwise specified. Data are weighted by annual nominal GDP converted to U.S. dollars at average market exchange rates as a share of the group GDP. In many countries, fiscal data follow the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The overall fiscal balance refers to net lending (+) and borrowing (–) of the general government. In some cases, however, the overall balance refers to total revenue and grants minus total expenditure and net lending. * **Sectoral Coverage:** Sectoral Coverage: General Government and Public Sector * **Temporal Coverage:** The Fiscal Monitor data are presented in annual frequency. **When:** Data exists from 1990 - 2021 **Type:** Time Series **Updated:** NA **Source Description:** ""The Fiscal Monitor surveys and analyzes the latest public finance developments, it updates fiscal implications of the crisis and medium-term fiscal projections, and assesses policies to put public finances on a sustainable footing."" **Cite:** Fiscal Monitor, International Monetary Fund The Data is provided to Users “as is” and without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.

The Future of Business survey was first launched as a monthly survey in 17 countries in February 2016 and expanded to 42 countries in 2018. In 2019, the Future of Business survey increased coverage to 97 countries and moved to a bi-annual cadence. The target population consists of SMEs that have an active Facebook business Page and include both newer and longer-standing businesses, spanning across a variety of sectors. To date, more than 90 million SMEs have created a Facebook Page, and more than 700,000 of these Facebook Page owners have taken the survey. With more businesses leveraging online tools each day, the survey provides a lens into a new mobilized, digital economy and, in particular, insights on the actors: a relatively unmeasured community worthy of deeper consideration and considerable policy interest. The survey includes questions about perceptions of current and future economic activity, challenges, business characteristics and strategy. Custom modules include questions related to regulation, access to finance, digital payments, and digital skills. The full questionnaire is available for download. This dataset contains survey response data aggregated by country and wave.

Summary as follows: * **95% of consumers say they’re** **spending more time on in-home media consumption / activities** * Unsurprisingly, the biggest spike is for watching more news coverage; 2 in 3 are spending more time doing this (half of whom are spending _significantly _more time on it) * Over 50% are watching more streaming services, 45% are spending more time on messaging services, almost 45% are devoting more time to social media, and over 10% say they are creating / uploading videos * China, the Philippines, Spain and Italy lead for increased usage of streaming services (over 50% in each country) * Over 70% in the Philippines say they are spending longer on messaging services * Spain, Brazil and Italy are ahead for increased gaming (40%+) * Age can be a huge influencer over behaviors here; 16-24s are five times as likely as 55-64s to report increased usage of music streaming services, and almost six times as likely to be creating / uploading videos * **Smartphone usage is up significantly** * 70% globally say they are spending more time on their smartphone, rising to 80% among 16-24s * It’s a trend that remains consistent across income groups and by gender * Location makes a big difference: 77% of urban respondents are spending more time on their smartphones, compared to 47% of rural consumers * **There’s widespread belief that the 2020 Olympics should not go ahead** * Only 5% now think they should go ahead regardless, peaking at 7% in Japan and the U.S. * Some 46% think they should go ahead only if the outbreak is completely or mostly over, 36% think they should be postponed, and 12% think they should be cancelled * Even in host country Japan, just over 50% believe they should be postponed or cancelled * **Large purchases could be delayed for a long time** * Almost 40% say they will buy major purchases they have delayed only when the outbreak begins to decrease or is over in their country * But close to 20% say they will wait until the outbreak decreases or is over globally * The top income group have a notable lead for being open to making their purchases once the national situation begins to improve * **Concern about the local vs global situation varies – in part based on where a country is in its journey** * In China, around 25% are very / extremely concerned about the situation in their country, whereas over 50% say the same about the global situation * In countries like France, Spain, UK, and the U.S., the figures are much more equal – in each case, between 50-60% are very / extremely concerned about the situations globally and in their own market * **Almost three quarters of consumers are interested in live streams of postponed events** * Live streamed sports events and music concerts are equally popular – over 4 in 10 are interested in watching them * A further 20% are interested in live-streamed theater shows * Age is a strong influencer here; almost 50% of 55-64s aren’t interested in any live streaming, compared to around 20% of 16-24s and 25-34s * Interest in live music concert streams drops in line with age, whereas interest in theater holds relatively steady * 25-34s and 35-44s are the most interested in live sports streams * **There’s a disconnect between how people think this will impact their personal finances, vs what will happen to the national or global economy** * Across the 13 markets, 30% think it will have a big or dramatic impact on their personal finances. But over 75% think the same about their country’s economy, and over 85% think it will have a big or dramatic impact on the global economy * The biggest gaps are found in France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the UK, where there’s at least a 50-point difference between the smaller numbers expecting it to have a big or dramatic impact on their personal finances vs the higher numbers expecting it to hit their country’s economy **SAMPLE SIZES and WEIGHTING** All stats are from a GlobalWebIndex custom recontact survey fielded March 16-20 among 1,004 (Australia), 1,001 (Brazil), 1,003 (China), 1,016 (France), 1,010 (Germany), 1,010 (Italy), 1,079 (Japan), 1,008 (Philippines), 1,008 (Singapore), 573 (South Africa), 1,005 (Spain), 1,040 (UK) and 1,088 (U.S.) internet users aged 16-64. In the interests of speed, 1,000 responses per country (500 in South Africa) were collected. The responses in each country have been weighted according to GWI's usual age, gender and education framework. In some countries, GWI collected relatively few responses in the 16-24 or 55-64 groups; where necessary, they have therefore combined weightings with adjacent age groups. **When:** March 2020 ​",eclerf,prod-user-client,2020-03-20T20:57:36.683,2020-04-20T22:38:45.232,PRIVATE,,covid 19;covid;coronavirus;virus;pandemic;travel;commute;health;healthcare;public health;crisis;market data

The index provides a rigorous benchmark of national-level Internet inclusion in 100 countries across four categories: Availability, Affordability, Relevance and Readiness. This year’s index, which covers 91% of the world’s population, is published for a third year alongside the Value of the Internet Survey, which polled 4,953 respondents from 99 countries, to gauge perceptions on how Internet use affects people’s lives and livelihoods. This executive summary presents the index and survey highlights. Key findings: Internet access is increasing globally, but vast disparities remain and the rate of uptake is slowing in the hardest-to-reach areas. Mobile data has been a game-changer for lower-income groups, but access is still too expensive. Although narrowing, the gender gap in access remains stubbornly wide, particularly in low- and lower-middle-income countries.

The files are presented in two different formats. The “Table” files present indicators for all states, counties, or HRRs, and can easily be exported from Excel to another data analysis program for additional analysis, while the corresponding “Report” files allow users to compare a specific state, county, or HRR to national Medicare benchmarks. The state- and HRR-level data include age breakouts (under 65, and 65 or older). Each file has a Documentation section which explains the individual indicators in more detail.

Most high-income oil exporters, primarily in the GCC, continue to record steady growth and solid economic and financial fundamentals, albeit with medium-term challenges that need to be addressed. In contrast, other countries --Iraq, Libya, Syria -- mired in conflicts with not just humanitarian but also economic consequences. And yet other countries, mostly oil importers, are making continued but uneven progress in advancing their economic agenda, often in tandem with political transitions and amidst difficult social conditions. In most of these countries, without extensive economic and structural reforms, economic prospects for the medium term remain insufficient to reduce high unemployment and improve living standards. Economic activity in the Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) region is weakening, mainly because of the near-term slowdown and rising regional tensions affecting Russia, a key trading partner and sources of remittance and investment inflows, as well as weaker domestic demand in a number of CCA countries. Near-term risks are to the downside and tied to the fortunes of large trading partners. Policies need to focus on bolstering economic stability and, where needed, short-term support to ailing economic growth. In addition, a new model for high, sustained, diversified, and inclusive growth is needed to set the direction for economic policies for the next decade."" **Cite:** MCDREO, International Monetary Fund The Data is provided to Users “as is” and without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.

Having children is universally recognised as one of the milestones that prompts the most changes in our behaviour, habits and lifestyle. The question is – does it also modify our interest in different types of video content? Globally, parents that live with their kids increase their interest in any type of Film or TV content regardless of the genre. Unsurprisingly, it also causes a substantial interest on family and children content (29% more compared to the those living on their own, with friends or with their partner).

Globally, 53% of men say they do often cook at home vs. 47% who say they don’t. Younger generations seem to be more open to cooking than the older ones (except for the 18-24 y.o. who still live with their parents). The internet has made it easier to access recipes, however, males’ aversion to spending time in the kitchen could be due to different factors: older men still expect women to cook, whereas younger men are overwhelmed with their hectic lives. Culture also has also a profound effect on males’ propensity to prepare food: in some countries, men are not expected to cook or eating out is very common; in others, males help more at home (especially if they are fathers) or eat healthier.

Simple answer, yes! As technology continues to evolve, Baby Boomers (55+) are not as interested in the latest technology as the younger generations and stick to more traditional media forms. Globally, they favour owning a standard desktop computer (68%, 94ix) over a tablet (43%, 89ix). Alternatively, Gen Z and Millennials live their lives through technology, queuing outside the likes of Apple and Samsung in the early hours, just to keep up with the latest gadgets.

Their behaviour on the field, the coverage of female events by media/brands sponsorship has also been scrutinised.

These annotated parking signs can help train OCR models to understand relevant signage for parking and self-driving cars, teaching models to ignore store signage, billboards, and other potentially confusing outdoor text. Parking sign detection combines computer vision, natural language processing, and spatial reasoning and is currently an ongoing project at Figure Eight. Our goal is to further the study using deep learning methods to build more accurate models and extend the parking sign detections to other cities and in particular dense areas where parking signs could be confused with man-made objects.

This dataset includes population estimates pertaining to the US Census **Age-Sex** topic area. New users are strongly encouraged to review the `00_README.md` documentation before using this data source. ## **Summary File Dataset Structure** Each ACS Dataset pertains to one specific Topic Area and is divided into 57 separate CSV files - * 1 for each of the US states, Puerto Rico, and Washington D.C (52 total) * 3 USA files * 2 metadata records Users may download these files for offline analysis, but the real value of this new distribution format is in using the data.world query tool to join ACS estimates to users' own data. ## **Finding The Data You Need** Users must consider 3 inputs to find the data they are looking for in the summary files: 1. Topic Area 2. Column IDs 3. Summary Level or Geography ### **Topic Area** data.world ACS Summary File datasets are already split across Topic Areas. This dataset focuses on the Age-Sex topic area. If you are looking for another topic area, go back to [data.world/uscensusbureau](https://data.world/uscensusbureau) to find the one you are looking for. Federated queries across multiple Topic Areas are possible with the data.world query tool. Please refer to the [data.world's SQL Tutorial](https://docs.data.world/documentation/sql/concepts/dw_specific/federated_queries.html) for more info. ### **Column IDs** Column ID numbers are required to query the data using the data.world query tool. Experienced Census users will recognize these Column IDs from ACS data from other distribution channels like the Census API and ACS R package. Column IDs are opaque, coded column headers that offer a great shorthand for `SELECT` ing the estimates you need in a query, but new users will need to explore the metadata file `02_ColumnKey.csv` to determine the columns they need. The `02_ColumnKey.csv` metadata file is included as a machine-readable CSV so users can query it with the data.world query tool as well. ### **Summary Level or Geography** All rows in the data.world ACS Summary File datasets are pre-geocoded. Geography codes like standard State Postal Abbreviations, State FIPS, County FIPS, Place FIPS, CBSA, ZCTA/ZIP, and Census GEOID codes are included to facilitate easy joining to users' own datasets. Experienced users may use the same Summary Levels available on other channels like the American FactFinder website. For more information about Summary Levels, please refer to the `00_README.md` documentation. With the exception of the **USA\_All\_States** files, the USA-level files do not contain geographies that are always entirely within a state, such as counties and places; for those data, go to the file for that state. ZIP Code Tabulation Areas are in the United States level (`USA_ZCTA.csv` ), because some ZIP codes span more than one state. Multi-table Select queries across multiple state files are possible with the data.world query tool. Please refer to the [data.world's SQL Tutorial](https://docs.data.world/documentation/sql/concepts/dw_specific/multi-tables.html) for more info. ### **Tips and Notes** * The `USA_All_States.csv` is provided for convenience so that users do not need to federate across all individual state files to return estimates for every state in the US. * Make your queries as selective as possible. Less selective queries will take longer to run and some may not return results at all due to the query timeout limit of 60 seconds. If you receive a `Network Error` upon querying the data, your query likely timed out and you should try a smaller slice of the data. * Most summary files are too wide to display in their entirety using data.world's fullscreen data table viewer. The data table viewer will stop displaying columns after the first 50. To view columns beyond the first 50, use the data.world query tool or download the file for offline analysis. **When:** 2020 **Cite:** American Community Survey (ACS) - Age-Sex, U.S. Census Bureau",eclerf,prod-user-client,2020-03-16T21:35:33.203,2020-05-07T20:00:06.475,PRIVATE,Public Domain,acs;usa;census;sex;age;census bureau;us census;market data

ZIP Code Tabulation Areas are in the United States level (`USA_ZCTA.csv` ), because some ZIP codes span more than one state. Multi-table Select queries across multiple state files are possible with the data.world query tool. Please refer to the [data.world's SQL Tutorial](https://docs.data.world/documentation/sql/concepts/dw_specific/multi-tables.html) for more info. ### **Tips and Notes** * The `USA_All_States.csv` is provided for convenience so that users do not need to federate across all individual state files to return estimates for every state in the US. * Make your queries as selective as possible. Less selective queries will take longer to run and some may not return results at all due to the query timeout limit of 60 seconds. If you receive a `Network Error` upon querying the data, your query likely timed out and you should try a smaller slice of the data. * Most summary files are too wide to display in their entirety using data.world's fullscreen data table viewer. The data table viewer will stop displaying columns after the first 50. To view columns beyond the first 50, use the data.world query tool or download the file for offline analysis. **When:** 2020 **Auto-Sync:** Weekly **Cite:** ACS\_2016\_5\_E\_HealthInsurance, US Census Bureau",eclerf,prod-user-client,2020-03-16T20:05:11.203,2020-04-20T22:49:27.325,PRIVATE,Public Domain,census;healthcare;health;insurance;united states;usa;market data

This dataset includes population estimates pertaining to the US Census **Residence Last Year & Migration** topic area. New users are strongly encouraged to review the `00_README.md` documentation before using this data source. ## **Summary File Dataset Structure** Each Census Topic Area is divided into 57 separate CSV files - * 1 for each of the US states, Puerto Rico, and Washington D.C (52 total) * 3 USA files * 2 metadata records Users may download these files for offline analysis, but the real value of this new distribution format is in using the data.world query tool to join ACS estimates to users' own data. ## **Finding The Data You Need** Users must consider 3 inputs to find the data they are looking for in the summary files: 1. Topic Area 2. Column IDs 3. Summary Level or Geography ### **Topic Area** data.world ACS Summary File datasets are already split across Topic Areas. This dataset focuses on the Foreign Birth topic area. If you are looking for another topic area, go back to [data.world/uscensusbureau](https://data.world/uscensusbureau) to find the one you are looking for. If you are looking for information regarding Residence Last Year and Migration, you are in the right place! Federated queries across multiple Topic Areas are possible with the data.world query tool. Please refer to the [data.world's SQL Tutorial](https://docs.data.world/tutorials/dwsql/#federated-queries) for more info. ### **Column IDs** Column ID numbers are required to query the data using the data.world query tool. Experienced Census users will recognize these Column IDs from ACS data from other distribution channels like the Census API and ACS R package. Column IDs are opaque, coded column headers that offer a great shorthand for `SELECT` ing the estimates you need in a query, but new users will need to explore the metadata file `02_ColumnKey.csv` to determine the columns they need. The `02_ColumnKey.csv` metadata file is included as a machine-readable CSV so users can query it with the data.world query tool as well. ### **Summary Level or Geography** All rows in the data.world ACS Summary File datasets are pre-geocoded. Geography codes like standard State Postal Abbreviations, State FIPS, County FIPS, Place FIPS, CBSA, ZCTA/ZIP, and Census GEOID codes are included to facilitate easy joining to users' own datasets. Experienced users may use the same Summary Levels available on other channels like the American FactFinder website. For more information about Summary Levels, please refer to the `00_README.md` documentation. With the exception of the **USA\_All\_States** files, the USA-level files do not contain geographies that are always entirely within a state, such as counties and places; for those data, go to the file for that state. ZIP Census Tabulation Areas are in the United States level (`USA_ZCTA.csv` ), because some ZIP codes span more than one state. Multi-table selects across multiple state files are possible with the data.world query tool. Please refer to the [data.world's SQL Tutorial](https://docs.data.world/tutorials/dwsql/#multi-table-selects) for more info. ### **Tips and Notes** * The `USA_All_States.csv` is provided for convenience so that users do not need to federate across all individual state files to return estimates for every state in the US. * Make your queries as selective as possible. Less selective queries will take longer to run and some may not return results at all due to the query timeout limit of 60 seconds. If you receive a `Network Error` upon querying the data, your query likely timed out and you should try a smaller slice of the data. * Most summary files are too wide to display in their entirety using data.world's fullscreen data table viewer.

We believe the lack of high quality datasets greatly limits the exploration of the community in this domain. To this end, we collected and organized a large-scale and comprehensive image database called VMMRdb, where each image is labeled with the corresponding make, model and production year of the vehicle. **Description** The Vehicle Make and Model Recognition dataset (VMMRdb) is large in scale and diversity, containing 9,170 classes consisting of 291,752 images, covering models manufactured between 1950 and 2016. VMMRdb dataset contains images that were taken by different users, different imaging devices, and multiple view angles, ensuring a wide range of variations to account for various scenarios that could be encountered in a real-life scenario. The cars are not well aligned, and some images contain irrelevant background. The data covers vehicles from 712 areas covering all 412 sub-domains corresponding to US metro areas. Our dataset can be used as a baseline for training a robust model in several real-life scenarios for traffic surveillance. ​ ![​](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/eb6a99e342e94bd33dc5bddc04114785f14e4d6e/687474703a2f2f766d6d7264622e6365637372657365617263682e6f72672f696d67732f6462486561746d61702e706e67) The distribution of images in different classes of the dataset.

Whereas a dataset should be considered a reusable asset that could act as an input to many different projects, a project should attempt to answer a question, complete a task, or explore a specific topic. See this article from the [data.world](http://data.world/) Help Portal for additional information: [https://help.data.world/hc/en-us/articles/115010469388-Start-with-a-question-or-task](https://help.data.world/hc/en-us/articles/115010469388-Start-with-a-question-or-task) Since this project was created for training purposes, the steps contained in the .md files below are based off an [existing piece of work exploring the relationship between politics and COVID-19 in the United States](https://dev.to/coolasspuppy/analyzing-the-politics-of-covid-19-through-public-data-22fe). This project will walk you through the queries and files created within the data.world project workspace in your own private project environment. Once you reviewed each file, you may begin to link additional datasets, create your own queries and visualizations, and explore the project workspace as you please. We will be walking you through a series of files to explain the work completed at this point. The files have been added to this dataset, and will be transferred to your private project when you are ready to create it. This project will review the following: [01.

It can also represent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular index includes roughly 88 percent of the total population, accounting for wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed, short-term workers, unemployed, retirees, and those not in the labor force. The CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, and fuels; transportation fares; service fees (e.g., water and sewer service); and sales taxes. Prices are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and approximately 26,000 retail establishments across 87 urban areas. To calculate the index, price changes are averaged with weights representing their importance in the spending of the particular group. The index measures price changes (as a percent change) from a predetermined reference date. In addition to the original unadjusted index distributed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also releases a seasonally adjusted index. The unadjusted series reflects all factors that may influence a change in prices. However, it can be very useful to look at the seasonally adjusted CPI, which removes the effects of seasonal changes, such as weather, school year, production cycles, and holidays. The CPI can be used to recognize periods of inflation and deflation. Significant increases in the CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of inflation, and significant decreases in CPI within a short time frame might indicate a period of deflation. However, because the CPI includes volatile food and oil prices, it might not be a reliable measure of inflationary and deflationary periods. For a more accurate detection, the core CPI ([CPILFESL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPILFESL)) is often used. When using the CPI, please note that it is not applicable to all consumers and should not be used to determine relative living costs. Additionally, the CPI is a statistical measure vulnerable to sampling error since it is based on a sample of prices and not the complete average. For more information on the consumer price indexes, see: Bureau of Economic Analysis. [""CPI Detailed Report.""](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) 2013.

Initially we relied only on data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Since March 19 our data is sourced from the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/coronavirus). We explain the reasons for this change in the section on the WHO below. The _European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control_ ECDC provides three statistical resources on the COVID-19 pandemic: * **[COVID-19 Dashboard](https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/COVID-19.html)** * **[Situation reports](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases)** * **[The daily data tables](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide)** The ECDC publishes full time-series data for the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths daily for countries around the world. Each day the ECDC collects data from 6am to 10am CET and publishes this data via its [COVID-19 dashboard](https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/COVID-19.html). This dataset is then also made publicly available through downloadable CSV files at 1pm CET. Its daily [Situation Reports](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases) are then update to reflect this new data from 2pm to 4pm CET. Our World in Data relies on this data and we make it accessible via our various visualizations in the [COVID-19 page](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). In case it is helpful for your work or you want to examine our version of the ECDC data in detail you can download all this data here: * **Total confirmed cases**: [https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/total\_cases.csv](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/total_cases.csv) * **Total deaths**: [https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/total\_deaths.csv](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/total_deaths.csv) * **New confirmed cases**: [https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/new\_cases.csv](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/new_cases.csv) * **New deaths**: [https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/new\_deaths.csv](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/new_deaths.csv) * **Full dataset**: [https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/full\_data.csv](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/full_data.csv) **When:** 2020.
